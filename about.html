                    <h4>Brief History</h4>
                    <p>
                         VTS is the official Seminary of the Christian Reformed Church Nigeria (CRC-N). It was first established in 1960 at Lupwe at the suburb of Takum now in Ussa Local Government, Taraba State, offering a lower level Pre-Seminary program in the English Language to prepare candidates for further theological studies at the <a href="#" target="_blank">Theological College of Northern Nigeria</a> (TCNN) in Bukuru, near Jos. <br><br>
                         Most of those who completed this training are actively involved in the church and government. In 1976, the Seminary started training pastors in the Hausa Language, while shortly thereafter, in 1981, the school was moved from Lupwe to Wukari. <br><br>
                         The school was moved to its present, permanent campus in 1990. The CRCN also used this opportunity to change the language of instruction from Hausa to English, an upgrade made neccessary by improving standards of education and rapidly cahnging conditions in
