                <h4>Master of Divinity Degree Program</h4>
                <p>
                    Veenstra Theology Seminary (VTS) in conjunction with University of Jos to which it is affiliated, offers a 2 year full time course leading to a Master of Divinity Degree. This Degree is also offered through a part time program over three and half (3.5) years. <br>

                    The curriculum for the Master of Divinity Degree is modeled on that of the Bachelor of Theology course. This M.Div too is designed for students who have not yet undertaken theological education studies, but have completed the Post Graduate Diploma in Theology (PGDT) at VTS or any Seminary recognized by VTS. <br>

                    It must be noted that the M.Div course is more demanding than the B.Th in two major ways: the study of M.Div is more intensive than B.Th study and the pass mark for M.Div is higher that of B.Th. <br>
                </p>
                <h5>Admission Requirement</h5>
                <p>
                    All candidates for the Master of Divinity Degree (full time or part time) must be recommended by the Seminary and qualified under any one of the following: <br>

                    i)	A First Degree in any subject/area from a recognized institution. <br>

                    ii)	A Higher National Diploma (HND) in any subject/area from a recognized institution. <br>

                    iii)	An equivalent qualification from a recognized institution. <br>

                    iv)	The completion of the Post Graduate Diploma in Theology (PGDT).

                </p>
                <h5>Special Regulations for the M.Div Degree</h5>
                <p>
                    The pass mark for all M.Div courses will be 50%. A student who does not attain this must retake a compulsory course; failed elective course may either be retaken or an equivalent course taken in their place. No re-sit examination are allowed according to the regulations of the University of Jos. Marks for failed courses will be recorded on the student’s transcript, but will not be considered in the calculation of the final Grade Point Average (GPA). <br>

                    The difference between the full time and the part time courses shall be the intensity of the part time courses and in the separation of the written assignments (which are to be done by the end of December following the teaching and examination of each course). In addition, lecturers are required to provide hand-outs for part time students, and the students are required to buy at least one text book per course. <br>

                    The part time course is organized on the basis of two modules per session; each four weeks long, with one week gap between modules i.e. a total of nine weeks in a session. The session (end of May to Early August) falls within the long vacation of each academic year.
                </p>
                <h5>Course Codification and Outline</h5>
                <p>
                    All the courses offered in the Master’s Degree Program are listed below with their code numbers. The numbers show the level, the semester and the number of course according to the specialty. Course descriptions are provided in a later section of this academic catalogue.
                </p>
                <h5>Course Requirement</h5>
                <p>
                    a.	The credit load required for the Master of Divinity Degree is 60 credit units as the minimum. These must be taken from the required courses. <br>

                    b.	A student may register for a maximum of 68 credit units. <br>

                    c.	The credit load for any year shall not exceed 34 credits, and not less than 30 credit units. <br>

                    d.	It is also required that the M.Div student  must pass Basic Hebrew and Basic Greek. The student may wish to pursue the study of Biblical Languages to the Further and Exegesis levels.
